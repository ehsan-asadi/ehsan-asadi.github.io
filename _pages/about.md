Welcome! I am a robotics scientist applying sensor fusion techniques and machine learning tools to autonomous systems in non-repetitive tasks, as well as devising new robotic machanisms for automation and field applications. 

I am a faculty (Asistant Professor) at the [RMIT university](https://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff-contacts/academic-staff/a/asadi-dr-ehsan) and researcher at Intelligent Automation group. I am also Co-Founder at [Transforma Robotics Pte Ltd](https://www.transformarobotics.com/) focusing on robotic systems and methods for infrastructure and automation. I am a Senior Member of IEEE Robotics and Automation Society and serve as Associate Editor of IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (IEEE RA-L)

I earned my Ph.D from the [Politecnico di Milano *at* Milan, Italy](https://www.polimi.it) and my BSc and MSc are in Mechanical Engineering.
My academic work is in sensor fusion for robotics vision, localisation and mapping, and developing robotic mechanisms and systems for manufacturing, infrastructure and health industries. 
I am teaching various courses for undergradutas [Mechatronics Principles and Autonomous System Design], and postgraduates [Advanced Robotics].
