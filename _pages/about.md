Welcome! I am a robotics scientist applying sensor fusion techniques and machine learning tools to create autonomous systems that can handle complex and non-repetitive tasks. Additionally, I design new robotic mechanisms for use in automation and field applications. 

Currently, I hold a faculty postition (Asistant Professor) at [RMIT university](https://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff-contacts/academic-staff/a/asadi-dr-ehsan) and am a researcher at the Intelligent Automation group. I am also a Co-Founder of [Transforma Robotics Pte Ltd](https://www.transformarobotics.com/) where we specialize in developing robotic systems and methods for infrastructure and automation. As a Senior Member of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, I am honored to serve as an Associate Editor of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (IEEE RA-L).

My academic background includes a Ph.D. from [Politecnico di Milano *at* Milan, Italy](https://www.polimi.it), as well as a BSc and MSc in Mechanical Engineering. My research primarily focuses on sensor fusion for robotics vision, localization, and mapping. I also specialize in developing robotic mechanisms and systems for industries such as manufacturing, infrastructure, and health.

In addition to my research, I am proud to teach courses on [Mechatronics Principles and Autonomous System Design] for undergraduates, as well as [Advanced Robotics] for postgraduates.
